### How to Run the Project

1. To run the Shape Tracker app, first navigate to this project's production directory called "ShapeTracker".  
2. In the command line, run `dotnet run` in the "ShapeTracker" directory to run the console app. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
3. Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.
